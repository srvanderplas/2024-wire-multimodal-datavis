	abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) sampling strategies can be used to simulate hidden Markov model ({HMM}) parameters from their posterior distribution given observed data. Some {MCMC} methods used in practice (for computing likelihood, conditional probabilities of hidden states, and the most likely sequence of states) can be improved by incorporating established recursive algorithms. The most important of these is a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions of the hidden states given observed data and model parameters. I show how to use the recursive algorithms in an {MCMC} context and demonstrate mathematical and empirical results showing a Gibbs sampler using the forward-backward recursions mixes more rapidly than another sampler often used for {HMMs}. Iintroduce an augmented variables technique for obtaining unique state labels in {HMMs} and finite mixture models. I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient use of {MCMC} output when estimating the hidden states. I directly calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space size by {MCMC}, circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently analyzed dataset in the {HMM} literature. The use of log-likelihood for assessing {MCMC} convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive checks are used to investigate application specific questions of model adequacy.},

We demonstrate a Bayesian cognitive model for understanding how people interpret visualizations in light of prior beliefs and show how this model provides a guide for improving visualization evaluation. In a first study, we show how applying a Bayesian cognition model to a simple visualization scenario indicates that people’s judgments are consistent with a hypothesis that they are doing approximate Bayesian inference. In a second study, we evaluate how sensitive our observations of Bayesian behavior are to different techniques for eliciting people subjective distributions, and to different datasets. We find that people don’t behave consistently with Bayesian predictions for large sample size datasets, and this difference cannot be explained by elicitation technique. In a final study, we show how normative Bayesian inference can be used as an evaluation framework for visualizations, including of uncertainty.},

We collected data including audio/video record of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interview; and analyzed the data using the grounded theory method. The primary result of this study is a grounded model of {NOvice}'s information {VIsualization} Sensemaking ({NOVIS} model), which consists of the five major cognitive activities: 1 encountering visualization, 2 constructing a frame, 3 exploring visualization, 4 questioning the frame, and 5 floundering on visualization. We introduce the {NOVIS} model by explaining the five activities with representative quotes from our participants. We also explore the dynamics in the model. Lastly, we compare with other existing models and share further research directions that arose from our observations.},

	abstract = {Draco has been developed as an automated visualization recommendation system formalizing design knowledge as logical constraints in {ASP} (Answer-Set Programming). With an increasing set of constraints and incorporated design knowledge, even visualization experts lose overview in Draco and struggle to retrace the automated recommendation decisions made by the system. Our paper proposes an Visual Analytics ({VA}) approach to visualize and analyze Draco's constraints. Our {VA} approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to accomplish identified tasks regarding the knowledge base and support them in better understanding Draco. We extend the existing data extraction strategy of Draco with a data processing architecture capable of extracting features of interest from the knowledge base. A revised version of the {ASP} grammar provides the basis for this data processing strategy. The resulting incorporated and shared features of the constraints are then visualized using a hypergraph structure inside the radial-arranged constraints of the elaborated visualization. The hierarchical categories of the constraints are indicated by arcs surrounding the constraints. Our approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to interactively explore the design rules' violations based on highlighting respective constraints or recommendations. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the prototype confirms the prototype's effectiveness and value in acquiring insights into Draco's recommendation process and design constraints.},

In this paper, we present a pipeline of applying a large body of graphical perception results to develop new visualization recommendation algorithms and conduct an exploratory study to investigate how results from graphical perception can alter the behavior of downstream algorithms. Specifically, we model graphical perception results from 30 papers in Draco—a framework to model visualization knowledge—to develop new recommendation algorithms. By analyzing Draco-generated algorithms, we showcase the feasibility of our method to (1) identify gaps in existing graphical perception literature informing recommendation algorithms, (2) cluster papers by their preferred design rules and constraints, and (3) investigate why certain studies can dominate Draco's recommendations, whereas others may have little influence. Given our findings, we discuss the potential for mutually reinforcing advancements in graphical perception and visualization recommendation research.},

We are mainly interested in systems that use a fully or partially automatic mechanism to recommend dashboards to users. This automation includes the suggestion of data and visualizations, the optimization of the layout and the use of user feedback. We position our work with respect to existing surveys. Starting from a set of over 1000 papers, we have selected and analyzed 19 papers/systems along several dimensions. The main dimensions were the set of considered visualizations, the suggestion method, the utility/objective functions, the layout, and the user interface.

In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Visual attention is essential in many areas ranging from everyday life situations to the workplace. Different circumstances such as driving in traffic or participating in sports require immediate adaptation to constantly changing situations and frequently the conscious perception of 2 objects or scenes at the same time. Method: The attention window task, a measure of attentional breadth, in which people must attend to 2 equally attention-demanding stimuli simultaneously, was introduced. This article provides a narrative review of studies using this task and outlines different factors that might influence the attention window. Results: Differences in the spatial distribution of attention result, for example, from effects of age or physical activities as well as from emotional processes and those affected by current motivation, while gender does not have any influence. The window is represented as an ellipse with greater attentional breadth along the horizontal axis than the vertical axis, and it is about 5 to 6 times smaller than the human visual field. Conclusion: Not only everyday occurrences but also situations in sport games—for example, having an overview of the opponent, teammates, and the ball—require the ability to pay visual attention to 2 peripheral objects and continuously changing situations. Therefore, the application or avoidance of different strategies and factors is discussed to improve and adjust behavior in those situations.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality ({VR}) is a promising tool to promote motor (re)learning in healthy users and brain-injured patients. However, in current {VR}-based motor training, movements of the users performed in a three-dimensional space are usually visualized on computer screens, televisions, or projection systems, which lack depth cues (2D screen), and thus, display information using only monocular depth cues. The reduced depth cues and the visuospatial transformation from the movements performed in a three-dimensional space to their two-dimensional indirect visualization on the 2D screen may add cognitive load, reducing {VR} usability, especially in users suffering from cognitive impairments. These 2D screens might further reduce the learning outcomes if they limit users’ motivation and embodiment, factors previously associated with better motor performance. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential benefits of more immersive technologies using head-mounted displays ({HMDs}). As a first step towards potential clinical implementation, we ran an experiment with 20 healthy participants who simultaneously performed a 3D motor reaching and a cognitive counting task using: (1) (immersive) {VR} ({IVR}) {HMD}, (2) augmented reality ({AR}) {HMD}, and (3) computer screen (2D screen). In a previous analysis, we reported improved movement quality when movements were visualized with {IVR} than with a 2D screen. Here, we present results from the analysis of questionnaires to evaluate whether the visualization technology impacted users’ cognitive load, motivation, technology usability, and embodiment. Reports on cognitive load did not differ across visualization technologies. However, {IVR} was more motivating and usable than {AR} and the 2D screen. Both {IVR} and {AR} rea ched higher embodiment level than the 2D screen. Our results support our previous finding that {IVR} {HMDs} seem to be more suitable than the common 2D screens employed in {VR}-based therapy when training 3D movements. For {AR}, it is still unknown whether the absence of benefit over the 2D screen is due to the visualization technology per se or to technical limitations specific to the device.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ({ADHD}) has seen a consistent rise in recent years. These numbers spark a debate over the reason for the observed trends, with some concerned about over diagnosis and over prescription of stimulant medications, and others raising the issue of diagnostic disparities, particularly in underrepresented populations. In this paper we look at both sides, starting with the history of {ADHD} and its diagnostic criteria changes, from early concepts of alterations in attention and hyperactivity in the 19th and 20th century, to its introduction in the Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({DSM}), and its evolution into how it is defined today. The general broadening of {ADHD} diagnostically over time plays a role in the increased prevalence over the years, but it is not the only reason. Increased awareness of physicians and the public is also believed to play a big role, particularly in underrepresented minorities and women. However, there continues to be disparities in detection of {ADHD} in these groups. There are significant consequences to a patient’s social, interpersonal, and professional life when {ADHD} is left unrecognized and untreated. Thoughtful evaluation, accurate diagnosis, and adequate treatment can make a big difference.},

	abstract = {Color is one of the most common ways to convey information in visualization applications. Color vision deficiency ({CVD}) affects approximately 200 million individuals worldwide and considerably degrades their performance in understanding such contents by creating red-green or blue-yellow ambiguities. While several content-specific methods have been proposed to resolve these ambiguities, they cannot achieve this effectively in many situations for contents with a large variety of colors. More importantly, they cannot facilitate color identification. We propose a technique for using patterns to encode color information for individuals with {CVD}, in particular for dichromats. We present the first content-independent method to overlay patterns on colored visualization contents that not only minimizes ambiguities but also allows color identification. Further, since overlaying patterns does not compromise the underlying original colors, it does not hamper the perception of normal trichromats. We validated our method with two user studies: one including 11 subjects with {CVD} and 19 normal trichromats, and focused on images that use colors to represent multiple categories; and another one including 16 subjects with {CVD} and 22 normal trichromats, which considered a broader set of images. Our results show that overlaying patterns significantly improves the performance of dichromats in several color-based visualization tasks, making their performance almost similar to normal trichromats'. More interestingly, the patterns augment color information in a positive manner, allowing normal trichromats to perform with greater accuracy.},

Spatial ability is considered an important indicator of potential talent in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}). This study explored undergraduate students’ spatial ability, focusing on mental rotation, by investigating the relationships of three variables with performance on a spatial ability test, in terms of test scores and test completion time. A three-way analysis of variance revealed statistically significant main effects of gifted program participation, choice of academic major, and gender, suggesting that students who participated in a gifted program, who majored in a {STEM} discipline, or who were male outperformed their counterparts on a measure of spatial ability when the other conditions were equivalent. No interaction effects existed among the three variables, indicating that none of them functioned as a moderator of students’ performance on the spatial ability assessment. However, when spatial ability was considered as a mediating variable in a path model, gender had the largest total effect on the probability of students majoring in a {STEM} area. In addition, the more time students spent on the spatial ability test, the better they tended to perform, which is a finding inconsistent with current literature.},

College students (N ϭ 421; ages 17–25; 73.1\% female) completed self-reports of {ADHD}, anxiety, and executive functioning in a laboratory setting. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that self-reported executive functioning deficits were significantly related to all 3 symptom domains. Executive functioning deficits were most strongly related to inattention followed by hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety. Analyses based on clinical groups revealed that groups with {ADHD} and comorbid anxiety showed greater deficits on self-regulation of emotion and self-organization/problem solving than those with {ADHD} only or anxiety only. Groups with {ADHD} showed greater deficits with self-motivation and self-restraint than those with anxiety only. All clinical groups differed from a control group on executive functioning deficits. Overall, anxiety symptoms appear to be associated with college students’ self-reported executive functioning deficits above and beyond relationships with {ADHD} symptomatology. Further, those with {ADHD} and anxiety appear to show increased difficulties with self-regulation of emotion and self-organization/ problem solving, a domain which appears to overlap substantially with working memory. Future studies should seek to replicate our findings with a clinical population, utilize both report-based and laboratory task measures of executive functioning, and integrate both state and trait anxiety indices into study designs. Finally, future studies should seek to determine how executive functioning deficits can be best ameliorated in emerging adults with {ADHD} and anxiety.},

This paper aids designers by providing a strategy for considering those general issues. It presents four considerations that abstract comparison. These considerations identify issues and categorize solutions in a domain independent manner. The first considers how the common elements of comparison-a target set of items that are related and an action the user wants to perform on that relationship-are present in an analysis problem. The second considers why these elements lead to challenges because of their scale, in number of items, complexity of items, or complexity of relationship. The third considers what strategies address the identified scaling challenges, grouping solutions into three broad categories. The fourth considers which visual designs map to these strategies to provide solutions for a comparison analysis problem. In sequence, these considerations provide a process for developers to consider support for comparison in the design of visualization tools. Case studies show how these considerations can help in the design and evaluation of visualization solutions for comparison problems.},

Here, we propose the new dynamical weighted evidence and visibility (dynWEV) model, an extension of the drift-diffusion model of decision-making, to account for choices, reaction times, and confidence simultaneously. The decision process in a binary perceptual task is described as a Wiener process accumulating sensory evidence about the choice options bounded by two constant thresholds. To account for confidence judgments, we assume a period of postdecisional accumulation of sensory evidence and parallel accumulation of information about the reliability of the present stimulus. We examined model fits in two experiments, a motion discrimination task with random dot kinematograms and a postmasked orientation discrimination task. A comparison between the dynWEV model, two-stage dynamical signal detection theory, and several versions of race models of decision-making showed that only dynWEV produced acceptable fits of choices, confidence, and reaction time. This finding suggests that confidence judgments depend not only on choice evidence but also on a parallel estimate of stimulus discriminability and postdecisional accumulation of evidence.},

	abstract = {Visualizations-visual representations of information, depicted in graphics-are studied by researchers in numerous ways, ranging from the study of the basic principles of creating visualizations, to the cognitive processes underlying their use, as well as how visualizations communicate complex information (such as in medical risk or spatial patterns). However, findings from different domains are rarely shared across domains though there may be domain-general principles underlying visualizations and their use. The limited cross-domain communication may be due to a lack of a unifying cognitive framework. This review aims to address this gap by proposing an integrative model that is grounded in models of visualization comprehension and a dual-process account of decision making. We review empirical studies of decision making with static two-dimensional visualizations motivated by a wide range of research goals and find significant direct and indirect support for a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations. Consistent with a dual-process model, the first type of visualization decision mechanism produces fast, easy, and computationally light decisions with visualizations. The second facilitates slower, more contemplative, and effortful decisions with visualizations. We illustrate the utility of a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations using four cross-domain findings that may constitute universal visualization principles. Further, we offer guidance for future research, including novel areas of exploration and practical recommendations for visualization designers based on cognitive theory and empirical findings.},

	abstract = {The visualization community has seen a rise in the adoption of user studies. Empirical user studies systematically test the assumptions that we make about how visualizations can help or hinder viewers' performance of tasks. Although the increase in user studies is encouraging, it is vital that research on human reasoning with visualizations be grounded in an understanding of how the mind functions. Previously, there were no sufficient models that illustrate the process of decision-making with visualizations. However, Padilla et al. [41] recently proposed an integrative model for decision-making with visualizations, which expands on modern theories of visualization cognition and decision-making. In this paper, we provide insights into how cognitive models can accelerate innovation, improve validity, and facilitate replication efforts, which have yet to be thoroughly discussed in the visualization community. To do this, we offer a compact overview of the cognitive science of decision-making with visualizations for the visualization community, using the Padilla et al. [41] cognitive model as a guiding framework. By detailing examples of visualization research that illustrate each component of the model, this paper offers novel insights into how visualization researchers can utilize a cognitive framework to guide their user studies. We provide practical examples of each component of the model from empirical studies of visualizations, along with visualization implications of each cognitive process, which have not been directly addressed in prior work. Finally, this work offers a case study in utilizing an understanding of human cognition to generate a novel solution to a visualization reasoning bias in the context of hurricane forecast track visualizations.},

	abstract = {Immersive Analytics ({IA}) uses immersive virtual and augmented reality displays for data visualization and visual analytics. Designers rely on studies of how accurately people interpret data in different visualizations to make effective visualization choices. However, these studies focus on data analysis in traditional desktop environments. We lack empirical grounding for how to best visualize data in immersive environments. This study explores how people interpret data visualizations across different display types by measuring how quickly and accurately people conduct three analysis tasks over ﬁve visual channels: color, size, height, orientation, and depth. We identify key quantitative differences in performance and user behavior, indicating that stereo viewing resolves some of the challenges of visualizations in 3D space. We also ﬁnd that while {AR} displays encourage increased navigation, they decrease performance with color-based visualizations. Our results provide guidelines on how to tailor visualizations to different displays in order to better leverage the affordances of {IA} modalities.},

Even though pie charts have been around for over 200 years, our understanding of the perceptual factors used to read data in them is still limited. Data is encoded in pie and donut charts in three ways: arc length, center angle, and segment area. For our first study, we designed variations of pie charts to test the importance of individual encodings for reading accuracy. In our second study, we varied the inner radius of a donut chart from a filled pie to a thin outline to test the impact of removing the central angle. Both studies point to angle being the least important visual cue for both charts, and the donut chart being as accurate as the traditional pie chart.},

In a series of experiments with simple bar graphs, the authors varied the rendering characteristics and relative heights of the bars and asked participants to estimate the quantities portrayed. The addition of 3-dimensional (3D) perspective depth cues lowered accuracy. This accuracy disadvantage diminished when a short delay was introduced before judgments were reported. The height of the judged bar relative to nearby graphical elements also affected accuracy; this effect was about 1 order of magnitude larger and remained intact when the delay was introduced. Nearby elements also affected viewers' bias (under- or overestimation). These effects do not seem to be due to misestimation of object depth. The results suggest that warnings about accuracy decrements due to 3D shading may be overstated, whereas distortions due to neighboring elements should be of more concern.

However, the study did not explore why these differences occur. In this paper, we describe a series of follow-up experiments to further explore and explain their results. While our results generally confirm Cleveland \& {McGill}'s ranking of various bar chart configurations, we provide additional insight into the bar chart reading task and the sources of participants' errors.

I also describe errors in the perceptual structuring of {HLS}, {HSV}, and {HSB} color models commonly available for computer graphics.},

	abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q–Q plots shows that de-trended Q–Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

We report an online experiment (N = 74) conducted to evaluate four alternative designs: 1) grouped bar chart, 2) grouped bar chart with difference overlays, 3) bar chart with difference overlays, and 4) difference bar chart. Results show that charts with difference overlays facilitate a wider range of comparison tasks while performing comparably to charts without them on individual tasks.

In this paper, we first introduce the basic principles of Rasch measurement that undergird the use of Rasch analysis in school psychology. Next, we describe several techniques that can be used to conduct a basic Rasch analysis. In doing so, we use Winsteps software to illustrate the application of these techniques with a single exemplar school psychology rating scale data set.

Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison, position’s high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were signiﬁcantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted. We also observed an effect of “perceptual pull”, where the average position estimate for each series was ‘pulled’ toward the other. These ﬁndings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased.},

We contribute a comparative analysis of different colormap types, with a focus on comparing single- and multi-hue schemes. We present a suite of experiments in which subjects perform relative distance judgments among color triplets drawn systematically from each of four single-hue and ﬁve multi-hue colormaps. We characterize speed and accuracy across each colormap, and identify conditions that degrade performance. We also ﬁnd that a combination of perceptual color space and color naming measures more accurately predict user performance than either alone, though the overall accuracy is poor. Based on these results, we distill recommendations on how to design more effective color encodings for scalar data.},

	abstract = {Color mapping is a foundational technique for visualizing scalar data. Prior literature offers guidelines for effective colormap design, such as emphasizing luminance variation while limiting changes in hue. However, empirical studies of color are largely focused on perceptual tasks. This narrow focus inhibits our understanding of how generalizable these guidelines are, particularly to tasks like visual inference that require synthesis and judgement across multiple percepts. Furthermore, the emphasis on traditional ramp designs (e.g., sequential or diverging) may sideline other key metrics or design strategies. We study how a cognitive metric-color name variation-impacts people's ability to make model-based judgments. In two graphical inference experiments, participants saw a series of color-coded scalar fields sampled from different models and assessed the relationships between these models. Contrary to conventional guidelines, participants were more accurate when viewing colormaps that cross a variety of uniquely nameable colors. We modeled participants' performance using this metric and found that it provides a better fit to the experimental data than do existing design principles. Our findings indicate cognitive advantages for colorful maps like rainbow, which exhibit high color categorization, despite their traditionally undesirable perceptual properties. We also found no evidence that color categorization would lead observers to infer false data features. Our results provide empirically grounded metrics for predicting a colormap's performance and suggest alternative guidelines for designing new quantitative colormaps to support inference.

	abstract = {Graphs have become a fixture of everyday life, used in scientific and business publications, in magazines and newspapers, on television, on billboards, and even on cereal boxes. Nonetheless, surprisingly few graphs communicate effectively, and most graphs fail because they do not take into account the goals, needs, and abilities of the viewers. In Graph Design for Eye and Mind, Stephen Kosslyn addresses these problems by presenting eight psychological principles for constructing effective graphs. Each principle is solidly rooted both in the scientific literature on how we perceive and comprehend graphs and in general facts about how our eyes and brains process visual information. Kosslyn then uses these eight psychological principles as the basis for hundreds of specific recommendations that serve as a concrete, step-by-step guide to deciding whether a graph is an appropriate display to use, choosing the correct type of graph for a specific type of data and message, and then constructing graphs that will be understood at a glance. Kosslyn also includes a complete review of the scientific literature on graph perception and comprehension, and appendices that provide a quick tutorial on basic statistics and a checklist for evaluating computer-graphics programs. Graph Design for Eye and Mind is an invaluable reference for anyone who uses visual displays to convey information in the sciences, humanities, and businesses such as finance, marketing, and advertising.},

	abstract = {Data analysis often involves the comparison of complex objects. With the ever increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with these comparisons is also growing. Increasingly, information visualization tools support such comparisons explicitly, beyond simply allowing a viewer to examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings. This initial exploration shows the power of our model, and suggests future challenges in developing a general understanding of comparative visualization and facilitating the development of more comparative visualization tools.},

	abstract = {A viewer can extract many potential patterns from any set of visualized data values. But that means that two people can see different patterns in the same visualization, potentially leading to miscommunication. Here, we show that when people are primed to see one pattern in the data as visually salient, they believe that na€ıve viewers will experience the same visual salience. Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what na€ıve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly inﬂuenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would ﬁnd the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reﬂects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice. The present ﬁndings show that the curse of knowledge also plagues the visual perception of data, explaining why people can fail to connect with audiences when they communicate patterns in data.},

Visual Selective Attention Dysfunctions (VSAD) are prevalent in children with Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Dyslexia. An important issue in the pediatric neuropsychological practice is how to discriminate between the task performance of these populations. We conducted a scoping review of the literature on visual search performance (VSP) in children with CVI, ADHD, and Dyslexia, aged 6\textendash 12 years. After a systematic selection process, 35 studies were included. Results suggest that all patient groups have some degree of impaired VSP compared to typically developing children. Children with CVI tend to react slower and less accurately. VSP impairments in children with ADHD are characterized by poor accuracy rather than reaction time. Children with Dyslexia tend to be slower and less accurate, depending on stimulus type. Besides VSAD, it is argued that other neurocognitive mechanisms might influence VSP, such as speed-accuracy trade-off or an executive functioning deficit in ADHD and a phonological deficit in Dyslexia. This paper further discusses the differences and similarities in visual search performance between the groups. The sparse data in children with an official diagnosis of CVI and the technical inconclusive data on children with ADHD and Dyslexia demonstrate complexity of discriminating between these populations in clinical practice based on VSP. New and more quantitative VSP parameters, such as eye tracking-based measures, may contribute to a refined classification among CVI, ADHD, and Dyslexia.},

Common methods of fitting trends by eye involve maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit is suitable, then drawing the line through the set of points. In 2015, the New York Times introduced an interactive feature, called ``You Draw It,'' where readers were asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality. In this article, we validate ``You Draw It'' as a method for graphical testing, comparing results to the less technological method used in Mosteller et al. and extending that study with formal statistical analysis methods. Results were consistent with those found in the previous study; when shown points following a linear trend, participants tended to fit the slope of the principal axis over the slope of the least-squares regression line. This trend was most prominent when shown data simulated with larger variances. This study reinforces the differences between intuitive visual model fitting and statistical model fitting, providing information about human perception as it relates to the use of statistical graphics.

	abstract = {Background
There is always a demand for fast and accurate algorithms for {EEG} signal processing. Owing to the high sample rate, {EEG} signals usually come with a large number of sample points, making it difficult to predict the working memory ability in cognitive research with {EEG}.
New Method
Following well-designed experiments, the functional linear model provides a simple framework for regressions involving {EEG} signal predictors. The use of a data-driven basis in a linear structure naturally extends the standard linear regression model. The proposed approach utilizes B-spline approximation of functional principal components that greatly facilitates implementation.
Results
Using {LASSO} feature selection, critical features have been extracted from eight frontal electrodes, and the R-square of 0.72 indicates rather strong linear association of actual observations and out-of-sample predictions.
Comparison with Existing Methods
There does not seem to be any existing methods of predicting working memory ability from N-back task tests via {EEG} signals; the data-driven functional linear regression method proposed in this work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind.
Conclusions
The data analytics suggest that a multiple functional linear regression model for the predictive relationship between working memory ability and frontal activity of the brain is both feasible and accurate via {EEG} signal processing.},

	abstract = {{EEG} provides a rich measure of brain activity that can be characterized as neuronal oscillations. However, most developmental {EEG} work to date has focused on analyzing {EEG} data as Event-Related Potentials ({ERPs}) or power based on the Fourier transform. While these measures have been productive, they do not leverage all the information contained within the {EEG} signal. Namely, {ERP} analyses ignore non-phase-locked signals and Fourier-based power analyses ignore temporal information. Time-frequency analyses can better characterize the oscillations contained in the {EEG} data. By separating power and phase information across different frequencies, time-frequency measures provide a closer interpretation of the neurophysiological mechanisms, facilitate translation across neurophysiology disciplines, and capture processes not observed by {ERP} or Fourier-based analyses (e.g., connectivity). Despite their unique contributions, a literature review of this journal reveals that time-frequency analyses of {EEG} are yet to be embraced by the developmental cognitive neuroscience field. This manuscript presents a conceptual introduction to time-frequency analyses for developmental researchers. To facilitate the use of time-frequency analyses, we include a tutorial of accessible scripts, based on Cohen (2014), to calculate time-frequency power (signal strength), inter-trial phase synchrony (signal consistency), and two types of phase-based connectivity (inter-channel phase synchrony and weighted phase lag index).},

A general and efficient algorithm for fitting a generalized additive model consists of a hierarchy of three modules: scatterplot smoothers, backfitting algorithm, and local-scoring algorithm. These three steps are a rather natural and intuitive generalization of the usual linear model algorithms, and that is how they were originally conceived. The algorithm for fitting a gam is exactly analogous to the algorithm for glms. The chapter presents the S functions for fitting and understanding generalized additive models. In some cases, especially for generalized linear or additive models, adding residuals to a plot is unhelpful because they can distort the scale dramatically. Any interesting features in the functions get lost because of a few large residuals, even though they may carry a very small weight.},

  abstract = {How do statistical regression results compare to intuitive, visually fitted results? Fitting lines by eye through a set of points has been explored since the 20th century. Common methods of fitting trends by eye involve maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit is suitable, then drawing the line through the set of points. In 2015, the New York Times introduced an interactive feature, called `You Draw It,' where readers are asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality. This research is intended to implement `You Draw It', adapted from the New York Times, as a way to measure the patterns we see in data. In this paper, we describe the adaptation of an old tool for graphical testing and evaluation, eye-fitting, for use in modern web-applications suitable for testing statistical graphics. We present an empirical evaluation of this testing method for linear regression, and briefly discuss an extension of this method to non-linear applications.},

We used grounded theory to code and examine concepts and relationships extracted. We found a variety factors, including domain, semantics, user tasks, insight, and display characteristics and found a variety of interactions between these factors including causal, contextual, and logical relationships. Our findings suggest that automatic approaches need to handle not only broader set of factors but also complex interactions among them. Furthermore, several factors such as domain and semantics are likely to gain even more importance, necessitating flexibility in terms the specification of design know-how as input to automatic visual analytics systems.},

In support of the evaluated theories, experts, when compared with non-experts, had shorter fixation durations, more fixations on task-relevant areas, and fewer fixations on task-redundant areas; experts also had longer saccades and shorter times to first fixate relevant information, owing to superiority in parafoveal processing and selective attention allocation. Eye movements, reaction time, and performance accuracy were moderated by characteristics of visualization (dynamics, realism, dimensionality, modality, and text annotation), task (complexity, time-on-task, and task control), and domain (sports, medicine, transportation, other). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of visual expertise in professional domains and their significance for the design of learning environments.},

  abstract = {Effective graphics are essential for understanding complex information and completing tasks. To assess graphic effectiveness, eye tracking methods can help provide a deeper understanding of scanning strategies that underlie more traditional, high-level accuracy and task completion time results. Eye tracking methods entail many challenges, such as defining fixations, assigning fixations to areas of interest, choosing appropriate metrics, addressing potential errors in gaze location, and handling scanning interruptions. Special considerations are also required designing, preparing, and conducting eye tracking studies. An illustrative eye tracking study was conducted to assess the differences in scanning within and between bar, line, and spider graphs, to determine which graphs best support relative comparisons along several dimensions. There was excessive scanning to locate the correct bar graph in easier tasks. Scanning across bar and line graph dimensions before comparing across graphs was evident in harder tasks. There was repeated scanning between the same dimension of two spider graphs, implying a greater cognitive demand from scanning in a circle that contains multiple linear dimensions, than from scanning the linear axes of bar and line graphs. With appropriate task design and targeted analysis metrics, eye tracking techniques can illuminate visual scanning patterns hidden by more traditional time and accuracy results.},

We began our investigations by gathering evidence that people have generic expectations about what types of information will be the major messages in various types of graphs. These graph schemata suggested how graph type and judgment type would interact to determine the speed and accuracy of quantitative information extraction. These predictions were confirmed by the finding that a comparison judgment was most accurate when the judgment required assessing position along a common scale (simple bar chart), had intermediate accuracy on length judgments (divided bar chart), and was least accurate when assessing angles (pie chart). In contrast, when the judgment was an estimate of the proportion of the whole, angle assessments (pie chart) were as accurate as position (simple bar chart) and more accurate than length (divided bar chart). Proposals for elementary information processes involving anchoring, scanning, projection, superimposition, and detection operators were made to explain this interaction.},

	abstract = {Appropriate evaluation is a key component in visualization research. It is typically based on empirical studies that assess visualization components or complete systems. While such studies often include the user of the visualization, empirical research is not necessarily restricted to user studies but may also address the technical performance of a visualization system such as its computational speed or memory consumption. Any such empirical experiment faces the issue that the underlying visualization is becoming increasingly sophisticated, leading to an increasingly difﬁcult evaluation in complex environments. Therefore, many of the established methods of empirical studies can no longer capture the full complexity of the evaluation. One promising solution is the use of data-rich observations that we can acquire during studies to obtain more reliable interpretations of empirical research. For example, we have been witnessing an increasing availability and use of physiological sensor information from eye tracking, electrodermal activity sensors, electroencephalography, etc. Other examples are various kinds of logs of user activities such as mouse, keyboard, or touch interaction. Such data-rich empirical studies promise to be especially useful for studies in the wild and similar scenarios outside of the controlled laboratory environment. However, with the growing availability of large, complex, time-dependent, heterogeneous, and unstructured observational data, we are facing the new challenge of how we can analyze such data. This challenge can be addressed by establishing the subﬁeld of visualization for visualization (Vis4Vis): visualization as a means of analyzing and communicating data from empirical studies to advance visualization research.},

The series of experiments reported here suggests that there is little to choose between the pie and the bar chart, with the former enjoying a slight advantage if the required judgement is a complicated one, but that both forms of chart are superior to the table. Thus our results do not support the commonly expressed opinion that pie charts are inferior. An analysis of the nature of the task and a review of the psychophysical literature suggest that the traditional prejudice against the pie chart is misguided.

By comparing subjects' verbalizations with their eye movements, we found stimulated RTA to be valid and reliable: the method provides a valid account of what people attended to in completing tasks, it has a low risk of introducing fabrications, and its validity is unaffected by task complexity. More detailed analysis of RTA shows that it also provides additional information about user's inferences and strategies in completing tasks. The findings of this study provide valuable support for usability practitioners to use RTA and to trust the users' performance information collected by this method in a usability study.},

We investigated how graph types (line, vertical bar, and horizontal bar graphs), graphic patterns (single and double graphic patterns), and question types (point locating and comparison questions) differentially affect graph comprehension of students with and without dyslexia. Groups were compared for (1) reaction times for answering comprehension questions based on graphed data and (2) eye gaze times for specific graph subregions (x-axis, y-axis, pattern, legend, question, and answer). Dyslexic readers were significantly slower in their graph comprehension than their peers with group differences becoming more robust with the increasing complexity of graphs and tasks. In addition, dyslexic readers' initial eye gaze viewing times for linguistic subregions (question and answer) and total viewing times for both linguistic (question and answer) and nonlinguistic (pattern) subregions were significantly longer than their control peers' times. In spite of using elementary-level paragraphs for comprehension and simple graph forms, young adults with dyslexia needed more time to process linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. These findings are discussed relative to theories proposed to address fundamental processing deficits in individuals with dyslexia.},

  abstract = {We investigate task performance and reading characteristics for scatterplots (Cartesian coordinates) and parallel coordinates. In a controlled eye-tracking study, we asked 24 participants to assess the relative distance of points in multidimensional space, depending on the diagram type (parallel coordinates or a horizontal collection of scatterplots), the number of data dimensions (2, 4, 6, or 8), and the relative distance between points (15\%, 20\%, or 25\%). For a given reference point and two target points, we instructed participants to choose the target point that was closer to the reference point in multidimensional space. We present a visual scanning model that describes different strategies to solve this retrieval task for both diagram types, and propose corresponding hypotheses that we test using task completion time, accuracy, and gaze positions as dependent variables. Our results show that scatterplots outperform parallel coordinates significantly in 2 dimensions, however, the task was solved more quickly and more accurately with parallel coordinates in 8 dimensions. The eye-tracking data further shows significant differences between Cartesian and parallel coordinates, as well as between different numbers of dimensions. For parallel coordinates, there is a clear trend toward shorter fixations and longer saccades with increasing number of dimensions. Using an area-of-interest (AOI) based approach, we identify different reading strategies for each diagram type: For parallel coordinates, the participants' gaze frequently jumped back and forth between pairs of axes, while axes were rarely focused on when viewing Cartesian coordinates. We further found that participants' attention is biased: toward the center of the whole plot for parallel coordinates and skewed to the center/left side for Cartesian coordinates. We anticipate that these results may support the design of more effective visualizations for multidimensional data.},

	abstract = {Almost 40 years ago, Cleveland and {McGill} published the first of 3 papers detailing experiments assessing the accuracy of numerical perception using different types of charts. This study is often cited as a reason to avoid the use of extraneous dimensions in data visualization: 2D bar charts produced more accurate estimates than 3D bar charts; in addition, lines (length) produced more accurate estimates than circles (area). Graphics have changed fairly significantly in the last 40 years: where we once had fixed 3D perspective charts, we now can rotate 3D renderings in digital space and even 3D print our charts to examine physically. Many optical illusions result from perceptual mismatches of 3D visual heuristics and 2D, planar, data representations; more realistic renderings available with modern tools might change the outcome of Cleveland and {McGill}’s experimental comparison of 2D vs. 3D accuracy. In this paper, we present several experiments which replicate the bar chart portion of Cleveland and {McGill}’s original study, comparing 2D, 3D fixed perspective, 3D rendered, and 3D printed charts. We discuss the findings and the importance of replicating classic experiments using modern technology, as well as the benefits of incorporating hands-on research in introductory classes as experiential learning activities.},

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called {APT} (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

This allowed us to determine what components of a visualization attract people's attention, and what information is encoded into memory. Our findings quantitatively support many conventional qualitative design guidelines, including that (1) titles and supporting text should convey the message of a visualization, (2) if used appropriately, pictograms do not interfere with understanding and can improve recognition, and (3) redundancy helps effectively communicate the message. Importantly, we show that visualizations memorable “at-a-glance” are also capable of effectively conveying the message of the visualization. Thus, a memorable visualization is often also an effective one.},

Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the effects of ink in the syntactic elements of a graph depend on the location and function of the element: redundant ink in the indicators had limited effects on performance, pictorial backgrounds generally increased response time and decreased accuracy, y axis tick marks generally increased response time, and the y axis line and the x axis generally decreased response time. The effect of each graphical element was conditional on the type of graph and task and the presence of other graphical elements. The discussion focuses on psychological principles that may underlie the effects of each syntactic element.},

The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks. The results largely empirically validate the intuitions of visualization designers and practitioners.

Focusing on the presentation of data per se can result in situations where these higher goals are ignored. This is especially the case for situations where cognitive or perceptual biases make the presentation of ``just'' the data as misleading as willful distortion. We argue that we need to de-sanctify data, and occasionally promote designs which distort or obscure data in service of understanding. We discuss examples of beneficial embellishment, distortion, and obfuscation in visualization, and argue that these examples are representative of a wider class of techniques for going beyond simplistic presentations of data.},

  abstract = {Rounding is a common phenomenon when subjects provide an answer to an open-ended question, both in experimental tasks and in survey responses. From a statistical perspective, rounding implies that the measured variable is a coarsened version of the underlying continuous target variable. Since the coarsening process is non-random, inference from rounded data is generally biased. Despite the potentially severe consequences of rounding, little is known about its causes. In this paper, we focus on subjects' uncertainty about the target variable as one potential cause for rounding behavior. We present a novel experimental method that induces uncertainty in a controlled way, thus providing causal evidence for the effect of subjects' uncertainty on the extent of rounding. Then, we specify and estimate a mixture model that relates uncertainty and rounding. The results suggest that an increase in the exogenous level of uncertainty translates into higher variance of the subjects' beliefs, which in turn results in more rounding.},

The proposed methods are further applied to detect the distributional difference of head circumferences from two Chernobyl impacted regions of Ukraine.},

However web surveys permit the use of continuous input devices such as slider bars, making VAS more feasible. The authors conducted an experiment to explore the utility of a VAS in a web survey, comparing it to radio button input and numeric entry in a text box on a series of bipolar questions eliciting views on genetic versus environmental causes of various behaviors. The experiment included a variety of additional comparisons including the presence or absence of numeric feedback in theVAS, the use of a midpoint or no midpoint for the other two versions, and numbered versus unnumbered radio button scales. The response distributions for theVAS did not differ from those using the other scale types, and theVAS had higher rates of missing data and longer completion times.},

In an experimental design, both scales were compared to standard HTML radio buttons and offered three, five, or seven response options. Slider scales negatively affect response rate (especially on mobile devices), the sample composition, the distribution of values, and also increase response times. VAS and radio buttons, however, can be used without negative side effects, even on touch screen devices like smartphones. Overall, it is recommended to avoid slider scales. As small differences in rating scales\textemdash here drag and drop versus point and click\textemdash have a huge influence on data collection, an optimal implementation of VAS is suggested. However, measurement of discrete variables with a moderate number of response options should be done with radio buttons scales unless a small screen size\textemdash for example, on smartphones\textemdash requires an economical use of space.},

  abstract = {Web surveys have expanded the set of options available to questionnaire designers. One new option is to make it possible to administer questions that respondents can answer by moving an on-screen slider to the position on a visual scale that best reflects their position on an underlying dimension. One attribute of sliders that is not well understood is how the position of the slider when the question is presented can affect responses?for better or worse. Yet the slider?s default position is under the control of the designer and can potentially be exploited to maximize the quality of the responses (e.g., positioning the slider by default at the midpoint on the assumption that this is unbiased). There are several studies in the methodology literature~that compare data collected via sliders and other methods, but relatively little attention has been given to the issue of default slider values. The current article reports findings from four web survey experiments (n = 3,744, 490, 697, and 902) that examine whether and how the default values of the slider influence responses. For 101-point questions (e.g., feeling thermometers), when the slider default values are set to be 25, 50, 75, or 100, significantly more respondents choose those values as their answers which seems unlikely to accurately reflect respondents? actual position on the underlying dimension. For 21- and 7-point scales, there is no significant or consistent impact of the default slider value on answers. The completion times are also similar across default values for questions with scales of this type. When sliders do not appear by default at any value, that is, the respondent must click or touch the scale to activate the slider, the missing data rate is low for 21- and 7-point scales but higher for the 101-point scales. Respondents? evaluation of the survey difficulty and their satisfaction level with the survey do not differ by the default values. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.},

When people use text boxes to make payments, they evaluate monetary values relative to the starting point of the response range. In contrast, when people use slider scales, they evaluate monetary values relative to the starting point as well as the end point of the response range. Consequently, payments elicited on slider scales tend to be assimilated toward the end point of the response range. This slider scale end point assimilation effect varies for ascending and descending payment formats. For ascending payment formats (e.g., eBay bids), slider scales elicit higher payments than text boxes. But for descending payment formats (e.g., Priceline bids), slider scales elicit lower payments than text boxes. This research not only documents how slider scales alter consumer payments, but also explains how the mental number line affects financial decisions.},

  abstract = {Many well-cited theories for visualization design state that a visual representation should be optimized for quick and immediate interpretation by a user. Distracting elements like decorative "chartjunk" or extraneous information are avoided so as not to slow comprehension. Yet several recent studies in visualization research provide evidence that non-efficient visual elements may benefit comprehension and recall on the part of users. Similarly, findings from studies related to learning from visual displays in various subfields of psychology suggest that introducing cognitive difficulties to visualization interaction can improve a user's understanding of important information. In this paper, we synthesize empirical results from cross-disciplinary research on visual information representations, providing a counterpoint to efficiency-based design theory with guidelines that describe how visual difficulties can be introduced to benefit comprehension and recall. We identify conditions under which the application of visual difficulties is appropriate based on underlying factors in visualization interaction like active processing and engagement. We characterize effective graph design as a trade-off between efficiency and learning difficulties in order to provide Information Visualization (InfoVis) researchers and practitioners with a framework for organizing explorations of graphs for which comprehension and recall are crucial. We identify implications of this view for the design and evaluation of information visualizations.},

Though many sources describe the foundations of the domain, few discuss practical methods for solving visualization problems. One frequently cited guideline to design is the "Visual information-seeking mantra", proposed by Shneiderman in 1996. Although often used to inform the design of information visualization systems, it is unclear what use this has been for visualization designers. We reviewed the current literature that references the mantra, noting what authors have found useful about it and why they cite it. The results indicate a need for empirical validation of the mantra and for a method, such as design patterns, to inform a holistic approach to visualisation design.},

However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.},

Although scatterplots are graphically complex, the quantity they convey is relatively simple. As such, it may be possible to assess the perception of correlation in a similar way. Scatterplots were each of 5.0\textdegree{} extent, containing 100 points with a bivariate normal distribution. Means were 0.5 of the range of the points, and standard deviations 0.2 of this range. Precision was determined via an adaptive algorithm to find the just noticeable differences (jnds) in correlation, i.e., the difference between two side-by-side scatterplots that could be discriminated 75\% of the time. Accuracy was measured by direct estimation, using reference scatterplots with fixed upper and lower values, with a test scatterplot adjusted so that its correlation appeared to be halfway between these. This process was recursively applied to yield several further estimates. Results of the discrimination tests show jnd(r) = k (1/b \textendash{} r), where r is the Pearson correlation, and parameters 0 {$<$} k, b {$<$} 1. Integration yields a subjective estimate of correlation g(r) = ln(1 \textendash{} br) / ln(1 \textendash{} b). The values of b found via discrimination closely match those found via direct estimation. As such, it appears that the perception of correlation in a scatterplot is completely described by two related performance curves, specified by two easily-measured parameters.},

  abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile\textendash quantile (Q\textendash Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q\textendash Q plots shows that de-trended Q\textendash Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

As a statistician, it is very useful to know how analysts make decisions based on plots, so that the plots can be improved for better performance. With the help of eye-tracking equipment, researchers can assess this. This paper describes the use of an eye-tracker for assessing how people look at lineup plots that are used in visual inference. The experiment included a comparison of several plot types, histogram, density, scatterplot and dotplot for two group data, and the use of side-by-side boxplots and scatterplots for assessing the importance of predictors in a regression model. Results are compared with those from a larger visual inference study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The eye-tracker can be manageably used only on a small sample of people, to give detailed information plot about reading behavior, so it is ideally used prior to a large human subjects study to help refine the experimental procedures, or as a post-processing step to better understand any surprises in the results.},

  abstract = {Research and development in computer science and statistics have produced increasingly sophisticated software interfaces for interactive and exploratory analysis, optimized for easy pattern finding and data exposure. But design philosophies that emphasize exploration over other phases of analysis risk confusing a need for flexibility with a conclusion that exploratory visual analysis is inherently ``model free'' and cannot be formalized. We describe how without a grounding in theories of human statistical inference, research in exploratory visual analysis can lead to contradictory interface objectives and representations of uncertainty that can discourage users from drawing valid inferences. We discuss how the concept of a model check in a Bayesian statistical framework unites exploratory and confirmatory analysis, and how this understanding relates to other proposed theories of graphical inference. Viewing interactive analysis as driven by model checks suggests new directions for software and empirical research around exploratory and visual analysis. For example, systems might enable specifying and explicitly comparing data to null and other reference distributions and better representations of uncertainty. Implications of Bayesian and other theories of graphical inference can be tested against outcomes of interactive analysis by people to drive theory development.},

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0\% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.},

Besides, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to video, audio and transcribed text content to obtain insights on the user experience of participants. The main motivations to develop UXmood are to support joint analysis of usability and user experience, to use sentiment analysis for supporting qualitative analysis, to synchronize different types of data in the same dashboard and to allow the analysis of user interactions from any device with a web browser. We conducted a user study to assess the data communication efficiency of the visualizations, which provided insights on how to improve the dashboard.},

How does this choice impact readers' beliefs about the size of treatment effects? We investigate this question in two experiments comparing 95\% confidence intervals (means and standard errors) to 95\% prediction intervals (means and standard deviations). The first experiment finds that participants are willing to pay more for and overestimate the effect of a treatment when shown confidence intervals relative to prediction intervals. The second experiment evaluates how alternative visualizations compare to standard visualizations for different effect sizes. We find that axis rescaling reduces error, but not as well as prediction intervals or animated hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs), and that depicting inferential uncertainty causes participants to underestimate variability in individual outcomes.},

This paper considers the role of reflection in the learning process and its link to deep learning in taxonomies of learning objectives. A simplified model of the stages of reflection is used as the basis for two workshops where staff and students are encouraged to consider the importance of reflection, the development of reflection from the most simple observations to higher levels, where issues and problems may be resolved, and then evaluate pieces of reflective writing for quality. An analysis of the initial results of student work after these workshops shows that the key factors in improving the quality of student reflection are time to reflect, reinforcement of the process and stages of reflection, an institutional culture of reflection and assessment. In conclusion, the paper discusses a future student-centred initiative and considers how the development of a culture of critical reflection depends not just on awareness but also has curriculum and resource implications.},

  abstract = {Computing is the dominant media of our times and a cultural artifact; generative art is a subject to make art and technology relevant to young people's experiences and bring art and the Stem subjects closer together as a value proposition for Steam. Generative art promotes the value of creativity, the creative industries and smart manufacturing within education to art, design and the core science subjects. It can also address the gender gap in Stem. It makes the scientific become the organic and can be used for young people to express themselves, socially, politically and economically. Whilst there is a declining uptake in GCSE art and design, arguably being not supported by the incoming EBacc curriculum, computer science forms part of the core science subjects. Policy makers are insistent that every child learns to code, but code what? 14\textendash 17 year olds, dubbed by the media in the UK as the ``Gen Z's'' view learning computer science as boring, for the geeks and male dominated. Generative art is a fun and approachable way of teaching programming and fits the curriculum as an extension of existing units of enquiry.},

Instructors are often discouraged with low attendance in office hours and consequently may fail to invest a significant amount of time in reaching out to students. This study explores the connection between office-hour attendance and academic performance in political science courses. For eight political science courses over four years, we record the number of times students visit office hours and their course grades (N = 406). Our findings indicate that office-hour visits are positively correlated with academic performance. In providing quantitative evidence that office hours can have a real and significant effect on academic performance, we hope this study may encourage instructors to actively invest in office hours. We conclude the study by providing four simple strategies instructors may implement to encourage engagement with students in office hours.},

Until now, the focus of these services have been on the technical aspects, supporting pupils with special educational needs and supporting teaching and learning of second language students. Only limited explorations have been attempted regarding its use for research purposes: transcription of audio recordings. This article presents a proof-of-concept exploration utilising three examples of automated transcription of audio recordings from different contexts; an interview, a public hearing and a classroom setting, and compares them against ‘manual’ transcription techniques in each case. It begins with an overview of literature on automated captioning and the use of voice recognition tools for the purposes of transcription. An account is provided of the specific processes and tools used for the generation of the automated captions followed by some basic processing of the captions to produce automated transcripts. Originality checking software was used to determine a percentage match between the automated transcript and a manual version as a basic measure of the potential usability of each of the automated transcripts. Some analysis of the more common and persistent mismatches observed between automated and manual transcripts is provided, revealing that the majority of mismatches would be easily identified and rectified in a review and edit of the automated transcript. Finally, some of the challenges and limitations of the approach are considered. These limitations notwithstanding, we conclude that this form of automated transcription provides ‘good enough’ transcription for first versions of transcripts. The time and cost advantages of this could be considerable, even for the production of summary or gisted transcripts.},

As the need for computationally-intensive methods to analyze large amounts of data grows, the criteria needed to achieve reproducibility, specifically computational reproducibility, have become more sophisticated. In general, prosaic descriptions of algorithms are not detailed or precise enough to ensure complete reproducibility of a method. Results may be sensitive to conditions not commonly specified in written-word descriptions such as implicit parameter settings or the programming language used. To achieve true computational reproducibility, it is necessary to provide all intermediate data and code used to produce published results. In this paper, we consider a class of algorithms developed to perform firearm evidence identification on cartridge case evidence known as the *Congruent Matching Cells* ({CMC}) methods. To date, these algorithms have been published as textual descriptions only. We introduce the first open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching Cells methods in the R package {cmcR}. We have structured the {cmcR} package as a set of sequential, modularized functions intended to ease the process of parameter experimentation. We use {cmcR} and a novel variance ratio statistic to explore the {CMC} methodology and demonstrate how to fill in the gaps when provided with computationally ambiguous descriptions of algorithms.},

	abstract = {Many data visualization experts recommend the use of bar charts over pie charts because they consider comparing the area or angle of segments to be less accurate than comparing bars on a bar chart. However, many studies show that when the pie chart is used to estimate proportions (arguably its main function) it is as accurate as the bar chart. A major issue is that most previous studies have only looked at one method of extracting information from pie charts, for example either by comparing the segment to the circle (the part-whole relationship) or one segment to another (relative magnitude estimation). Therefore, in this study I test multiple metrics to provide a more holistic assessment of the pie and donut chart against the bar chart. I also measured cognitive load through pupillometry. In summary, bar charts were more precise than pie and donut charts for ranking elements, but all charts were equally accurate for extracting the part-whole relationship. There was little difference in cognitive load between chart types, although bar charts were consistently faster to use on average. Overall, the bar chart was more flexible, but where there were statistically significant differences between charts, the effect sizes were often small, and unlikely to prevent effective extraction of quantitative information. That is, as long as they were used appropriately, all chart types were arguably acceptable for displaying simple, categorical data.},

It is thus crucial to visualize relevant data efficiently so that employees are able to extract relevant information most accurately and quickly. However, at present, information visualization research lacks a coherent and evidence based theoretical framework providing clear guidelines on how to design efficient visualizations. When it comes to the use of redundant elements in charts like commonly used data labels, cognitive fit theory and cognitive load theory make different predictions. Whereas the latter assumes that redundant labels generally reduce visualizations’ efficiency due to increased cognitive load, cognitive fit theory predicts increased efficiency for some task types that shall be solved by means of the visualization. In the online experiment presented in this paper, we investigated the effect of data labels in line and bar charts on users’ accuracy and speed in solving chart-related business tasks dependent on different task types. Our results reveal that users perceive charts with redundant labels as significantly more efficient and answer related questions significantly more accurate and faster, which we explain by the help of cognitive fit theory. We provide valuable insights into cognitive processing of charts and encourage graph designers to consider redundant elements as a possible means to increase efficiency under particular circumstances.},

This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classification systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has received a surge of interest in recent years thanks to its benefits in data privacy protection, efficient communication, and parallel data processing. Also, with appropriate algorithmic designs, one could achieve the desirable linear speedup for convergence effect in FL. However, most existing works on FL are limited to systems with i.i.d. data and centralized parameter servers and results on decentralized FL with heterogeneous datasets remains limited. Moreover, whether or not the linear speedup for convergence is achievable under fully decentralized FL with data heterogeneity remains an open question. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new algorithm, called NET-FLEET, for fully decentralized FL systems with data heterogeneity. The key idea of our algorithm is to enhance the local update scheme in FL (originally intended for communication efficiency) by incorporating a recursive gradient correction technique to handle heterogeneous datasets. We show that, under appropriate parameter settings, the proposed NET-FLEET algorithm achieves a linear speedup for convergence. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed NET-FLEET algorithm and verify our theoretical findings.},

Previous research has demonstrated that number perception influences the allocation of spatial attention, such that the presentation of a spatially nonpredictive number at fixation results in attention being allocated to the left when the central number is low (e.g., 1), and attention being allocated to the right when the central number is high (e.g., 9). Here, we examine whether this attentional SNARC effect (spatial numerical association of response codes) generalizes to other ordinal sequences: letters, days, and months. Though we replicate the attentional SNARC we find that this effect is number-specific, unless participants are required to process the cue in an order-relevant fashion. This discovery of number-specificity has important implications both for the functional separation between SNARC and attention-SNARC effects, as well as lending support to recent theories regarding the specificity of a shared neural architecture between numbers and visuospatial attention.},

  abstract = {We report three experiments that examine the influence of pointing-to relative to passively viewing an array of objects that participants are attempting to memorize. Recently, Chum, Bekkering, Dodd, and Pratt (2007) provided evidence that pointing to objects enhanced memory relative to passively viewing objects when pointing instruction was manipulated within trial (e.g., point to one array but passively view the other). We replicate this result but also demonstrate that when pointing instruction is blocked (e.g., participants point to or passively view all items in an array as opposed to pointing to some while passively viewing others), pointing to an array of objects actually decreases memory relative to passively viewing that array. Moreover, when pointing is manipulated within trial, the influence of action on working-memory performance appears to be attributable to an enhancement of processing of the pointed-to items as well as a subsequent inhibition of the passively viewed array. These results demonstrate that while action can enhance working memory under conditions where a subset of items is actively selected for additional processing, when selection is not a requirement (e.g., either point to everything or passively view everything), action decreases working-memory performance. Thus, the relationship between action and spatial working memory is complex and context dependent. These results are also discussed as they relate to other similar phenomena (e.g., retrieval-induced forgetting, Corsi Blocks test) in which selection during processing may be critical, and collectively these results provide important insight into spatial working memory and the factors that influence it.}

Participants were shown a series of scenes and were asked to (a) search each scene for a target, (b) memorize each scene, (c) rate how pleasant each scene was, or (d) view each scene freely. An examination of saccadic reaction times to probes provided evidence of IOR during search: Participants were slower to look at probes at previously fixated locations than to look at probes at novel locations. For the other three conditions, however, the opposite pattern of results was observed: Participants were faster to look at probes at previously fixated locations than to look at probes at novel locations, a facilitation-of-return effect that has not been reported previously. These results demonstrate that IOR is a search-specific strategy and not a general characteristic of visual attention.}

The main purpose of this work was to examine the objectifying gaze toward women via eye tracking technology. A secondary purpose was to examine the impact of body shape on this objectifying gaze. To elicit the gaze, we asked participants (29 women, 36 men from a large Midwestern University in the U.S.), to focus on the appearance (vs. personality) of women and presented women with body shapes that fit cultural ideals of feminine attractiveness to varying degrees, including high ideal (i.e., hourglassshaped women with large breasts and small waist-to-hip ratios), average ideal (with average breasts and average waist-to-hip ratios), and low ideal (i.e., with small breasts and large waist-tohip ratios). Consistent with our main hypothesis, we found that participants focused on women's chests and waists more and faces less when they were appearance-focused (vs. personalityfocused). Moreover, we found that this effect was particularly pronounced for women with high (vs. average and low) ideal body shapes in line with hypotheses. Finally, compared to female participants, male participants showed an increased tendency to initially exhibit the objectifying gaze and they regarded women with high (vs. average and low) ideal body shapes more positively, regardless of whether they were appearance-focused or personality-focused. Implications for objectification and person perception theories are discussed.},

  abstract = {The risk of major occupational accidents involving tripping hazards is commonly underestimated with a large number of studies having been conducted to better understand variables that affect situation awareness: the ability to detect, perceive, and comprehend constantly evolving surroundings. An important property that affects situation awareness is the limited capacity of the attentional system. To maintain situation awareness while exposed to tripping hazards, a worker needs to obtain feedforward information about hazards, detect immediate tripping hazards, and visually scan surroundings for any potential environmental hazards. Despite the importance of situation awareness, its relationship with attention remains unknown in the construction industry. To fill this theoretical knowledge gap, this study examines differences in attentional allocation between workers with low and high situation awareness levels while exposed to tripping hazards in a real construction site. Participants were exposed to tripping hazards on a real jobsite while walking along a path in the presence of other workers. Situation awareness was measured using the situation awareness rating technique, and subjects' eye movements were tracked as direct measures of attention via a wearable mobile eye tracker. Investigating the attentional distribution of subjects by examining fixation-count heat maps and scan paths revealed that as workers with higher situation awareness walked, they periodically looked down and scanned ahead to remain fully aware of the environment and its associated hazards. Furthermore, this study quantitatively compared the differences between the eye-tracking metrics of worker with different situation awareness levels (low versus high) using permutation simulation. The results of the statistical analysis indicate that subjects did not allocate their attention equally to all hazardous areas of interest, and these differences in attentional distribution were modulated by the workers' level of situation awareness. This study advances theory by presenting one of the first attempts to use mobile eye-tracking technology to examine the role of cognitive processes (i.e., attention) in human error (i.e., failure to identify a hazard) and occupational accidents.

  abstract = {Eye-movement metrics have been shown to correlate with attention and, therefore, represent a means of identifying and analyzing an individual's cognitive processes. Human errors\textemdash such as failure to identify a hazard\textemdash are often attributed to a worker's lack of attention. Piecemeal attempts have been made to investigate the potential of harnessing eye movements as predictors of human error (e.g., failure to identify a hazard) in the construction industry, although more attempts have investigated human error via subjective measurements. To address this knowledge gap, the present study harnessed eye-tracking technology to evaluate the impacts of workers' hazard-identification skills on their attentional distributions and visual search strategies. To achieve this objective, an experiment was designed in which the eye movements of 31 construction workers were tracked while they searched for hazards in 35 randomly ordered construction scenario images. Workers were then divided into three groups on the basis of their hazard identification performance. Three fixation-related metrics\textemdash fixation count, dwell-time percentage, and run count\textemdash were analyzed during the eye-tracking experiment for each group (low, medium, and high hazard-identification skills) across various types of hazards. Then, multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was used to evaluate the impact of workers' hazard-identification skills on their visual attention. To further investigate the effect of hazard identification skills on the dependent variables (eye movement metrics), two distinct processes followed: separate ANOVAs on each of the dependent variables, and a discriminant function analysis. The analyses indicated that hazard identification skills significantly impact workers' visual search strategies: workers with higher hazard-identification skills had lower dwell-time percentages on ladder-related hazards; higher fixation counts on fall-to-lower-level hazards; and higher fixation counts and run counts on fall-protection systems, struck-by, housekeeping, and all hazardous areas combined. Among the eye-movement metrics studied, fixation count had the largest standardized coefficient in all canonical discriminant functions, which implies that this eye-movement metric uniquely discriminates workers with high hazard-identification skills and at-risk workers. Because discriminant function analysis is similar to regression, discriminant function (linear combinations of eye-movement metrics) can be used to predict workers' hazard-identification capabilities. In conclusion, this study provides a proof of concept that certain eyemovement metrics are predictive indicators of human error due to attentional failure. These outcomes stemmed from a laboratory setting, and, foreseeably, safety managers in the future will be able to use these findings to identify at-risk construction workers, pinpoint required safety training, measure training effectiveness, and eventually improve future personal protective equipment to measure construction workers' situation awareness in real time.

  abstract = {Although several studies have highlighted the importance of attention in reducing the number of injuries in the construction industry, few have attempted to empirically measure the attention of construction workers. One technique that can be used to measure worker attention is eye tracking, which is widely accepted as the most direct and continuous measure of attention because where one looks is highly correlated with where one is focusing his or her attention. Thus, with the fundamental objective of measuring the impacts of safety knowledge (specifically, training, work experience, and injury exposure) on construction workers' attentional allocation, this study demonstrates the application of eye tracking to the realm of construction safety practices. To achieve this objective, a laboratory experiment was designed in which participants identified safety hazards presented in 35 construction site images ordered randomly, each of which showed multiple hazards varying in safety risk. During the experiment, the eye movements of 27 construction workers were recorded using a head-mounted EyeLink II system. The impact of worker safety knowledge in terms of training, work experience, and injury exposure (independent variables) on eyetracking metrics (dependent variables) was then assessed by implementing numerous permutation simulations. The results show that tacit safety knowledge acquired from work experience and injury exposure can significantly improve construction workers' hazard detection and visual search strategies. The results also demonstrate that (1) there is minimal difference, with or without the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 10-h certificate, in workers' search strategies and attentional patterns while exposed to or seeing hazardous situations; (2) relative to less experienced workers ({$<$}5 years), more experienced workers ({$>$}10 years) need less processing time and deploy more frequent short fixations on hazardous areas to maintain situational awareness of the environment; and (3) injury exposure significantly impacts a worker's visual search strategy and attentional allocation. In sum, practical safety knowledge and judgment on a jobsite requires the interaction of both tacit and explicit knowledge gained through work experience, injury exposure, and interactive safety training. This study significantly contributes to the literature by demonstrating the potential application of eye-tracking technology in studying the attentional allocation of construction workers. Regarding practice, the results of the study show that eye tracking can be used to improve worker training and preparedness, which will yield safer working conditions, detect at-risk workers, and improve the effectiveness of safety-training programs.

Participants fixated faster and longer on the upper features of White faces and the lower features of African American faces. When instructing participants to attend to certain features in African American faces, this pattern was exaggerated. Gaze patterns were related to improved recognition accuracy.}

Here, we find that more participant-directed tasks (in which the task establishes general goals of viewing rather than specific objects to fixate) affect not only spatial (e.g., saccade amplitude) but also temporal parameters (e.g., fixation duration). Further, task set influenced the rate of change in fixation duration over the course of viewing but not saccade amplitude, suggesting independent mechanisms for control of these parameters.},

The current study adds to this literature by examining the effects of state anxiety on visual attention and testing the vigilance\textendash{} avoidance hypothesis, using a method of continuous visual attentional assessment. Participants were 91 undergraduate college students with high or low trait fear of negative evaluation (FNE), a core aspect of social anxiety, who were randomly assigned to either a high or low state anxiety condition. Participants engaged in a free view task in which pairs of emotional facial stimuli were presented and eye movements were continuously monitored. Overall, participants with high FNE avoided angry stimuli and participants with high state anxiety attended to positive stimuli. Participants with high state anxiety and high FNE were avoidant of angry faces, whereas participants with low state and low FNE exhibited a bias toward angry faces. The study provided partial support for the vigilance\textendash avoidance hypothesis. The findings add to the mixed results in the literature that suggest that both positive and negative emotional stimuli may be important in understanding the complex attention patterns associated with social anxiety.

Although web technologies make interactive graphics more accessible, they are not designed to fit inside an exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow where rapid iteration between data manipulation, modeling, and visualization must occur. To better facilitate exploratory web graphics that are easily distributed, we need better interfaces between statistical computing environments (e.g., the R language) and client-side web technologies.
